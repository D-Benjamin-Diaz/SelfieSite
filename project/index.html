      Hi I am Ben Diaz. I'm a Computer Science major at Augusta University seeking
      to graduate next Spring (2026). Currently, I'm a IT Technician Student Assistant
      at Augusta University.
    </p>

    <p>
      My experience in the IT department portrays my experience and interest
      in computers and systems. I also have worked previously for Applaudo Studios
      as a C# developer intern where I worked on a company project developing APIs
      with the Developers Team.

    <h3>About Me</h3>

    <p>
      I'm originally from San Salvador, the capital city of El Salvador. Country
      where I grew up and my family currently lives in. I'm the 2nd of six kids
      where all the high school graduates are studying abroad in either the US or
      Spain. And though we are far from home, we are always keeping up on each other.
    </p>

      One of the things that I enjoy the most is playing Golf. My dad discovered
      this beautiful sport a while ago and he taught me and my brothers how to
      play. But what I like the most about this sport is the ethics and virtues
      behind it and that almost every player respects. Those kind of virtues best
      represent my behavior and work ethic.
    </p>

    <p>
      A few years ago I was part of an Scholars Program for international students.
      In this program, every student was treated as an embassdor of his country.
      There, I had the chance to meet a lot of people from different backgrounds
      and who spoke different languages. And even though we were all different in
      some way, we are all friends who are willing to offer a hand when someone
      else needs it.
